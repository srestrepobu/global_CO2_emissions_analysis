# global_CO2_emissions_analysis
## Description
An interactive data visualization dashboard analyzing global CO₂ emissions patterns from 1970 to 2024. This project presents comprehensive insights into carbon dioxide emissions across different dimensions: temporal trends, geographical distribution, sectoral breakdown, and socioeconomic correlations. The dashboard features multiple coordinated visualizations including line charts, bar charts, treemaps, scatter plots, and choropleth maps to provide a multi-faceted view of global emission patterns.

## Features
Global Emission Trends (1970-2024): Historical timeline showing the growth of CO₂ emissions from 15,751 Mt in 1970 Continental Distribution: Analysis of emissions by continent, highlighting Asia's dominant contribution (81.3% in 2024) Sectoral Breakdown: Stacked bar charts showing emissions from Power Industry, Transport, Industrial Combustion, Buildings, Processes, Fuel Exploitation, Waste, and Agriculture sectors Country Comparisons: Visualization of top emitters including China (36.4%), USA (12.6%), India (8.7%), with Colombia included for regional context Treemap Analysis: Proportional representation of country-level emissions in 2024 Life Expectancy Correlation: Scatter plot analyzing the relationship between CO₂ emissions per capita and life expectancy across regions Regional Deep Dive: Detailed map of South America showing emissions by country, with Brazil leading at 491 Mt

## Key Insights
Global emissions have increased from ~15,750 Mt (1970) to ~39,489 Mt (2024) Asia accounts for over 81% of global emissions in 2024 Power Industry remains the largest sectoral contributor Strong correlation exists between per capita emissions and life expectancy Colombia contributes 95 Mt of CO₂ emissions in South America

## Data Sources
Visualizations are based on emissions data spanning 1970-2024, with historical context from 1970 onwards, covering:

## Territorial emissions by country
Sectoral emissions breakdown Population and life expectancy statistics

## Technologies Used
Python data visualization libraries (Matplotlib/Plotly) Statistical analysis tools Geospatial mapping capabilities

## Use Cases
Climate policy research and analysis Environmental education and awareness Regional emission benchmarking Sector-specific emission tracking Academic research on climate change

## Future Enhancements
Real-time data integration Per capita emissions analysis Emission intensity metrics Renewable energy transition tracking Predictive modeling for future emission scenarios
